# Stroke Prediction App in R



This project involved developing a Shiny web application for personalized stroke risk prediction using machine learning techniques. The application allows users to input various health parameters, such as age, gender, hypertension, and BMI, and provides an estimate of their risk of experiencing a stroke. The machine learning model used in the app was trained on a dataset containing information about various health factors and stroke occurrences. The goal was to create a user-friendly tool that could help individuals assess their stroke risk and potentially take preventive measures
